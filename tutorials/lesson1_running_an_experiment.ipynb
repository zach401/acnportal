We also provide the start time of the simulation which all internal timestamps will be measured relative to. Finally we pass in the length of each period as well as a parameter called max_recomp. max_recomp controls how often the scheduling algorithm is called when no events occur. Here we have set max_recomp to 1, meaning the scheduling algorithm will be called every time step. If we had set it to 5, up to 5 time steps could occur before the scheduling algorithm was called. Note that the scheduling algorithm is always called when an event occurs. In this case, UncontrolledCharging only provides one charging rate, so it must be used with a max_recomp of 1."
